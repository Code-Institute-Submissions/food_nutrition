# Nutrition Value

Milestone project from **Data Centric Development**

## Data

The data is the nutrional value per 100g (or 100ml for liquids).

* Energy (kJ)
* Energy (kcal)
* Fat
* Saturated Fat
* Carbohydrates
* Sugars
* Fibre
* Protein
* Salt
* Classification
* Shop
* Notes

Others might include:
B12 and Calcium.

I want to allow for data which in Not Available (**NA**) and values which are marked as less than (**<**).

## Pages

1. I will have a home page with some description of the project and instructions for using the application.
2. I will have a page to add data [**C**]. This will be reached from a menu item.
3. I will have a page to display [**R**] the items. I will use an accordion structure. I can do one of two things:
    1. There will be a button to lead to a more details. Here there will be a button to delete the item.
    2. All the details will show once an accordion fold is open. There will be a button to delete the item on the accordion item header.
4. In any case the delete [**D**] button will either open a modal or take the user to another page for confirmation.
5. I will have an edit page [**U**]. It will be structured like the add page but will be prepopulated with the data for the particular item to be edited. There will be a button to save the changes or leave without saving changes.
6. There will be a **Dashboard** with DC.js graphs with filters and the possibility to select an item and go to the item's detail page. (Or the accordion fold of that particular item.)

## Deploy to Heroku

Name of app: **food-nutrition**  
URI: [https://food-nutrition.herokuapp.com/]()

I am using ***gunicorn*** server. I found that I will have to set less settings myself.  
The differences include:
1. I do NOT need to run ```heroku ps:scale web=1```
2. I do NOT need to manually set the IP and PORT variables in *settings > Reveal Config Vars*.
3. I do NOT need to *Restart all Dynos* from *More*.

In all, using gunicorn makes deploying to Heroku much easier.

The commands needed are: (using this app as example)
1. Install gunicorn
~~~~
pip3 install gunicorn
~~~~

2. Create Procfile
~~~~
echo web: gunicorn run:app > Procfile
~~~~

3. Create/Update requirements.txt
~~~~
sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
~~~~

4. Create the Heroku on the website (allows me to set Region to EU)

5. Log in to heroku (locally, need email and password) and check the apps
~~~~
heroku login
heroku apps
~~~~

6. Initialise git, if not already done and set a remote for heroku
~~~~
git init
heroku git:remote -a food-nutrition
~~~~

7. Push to Heroku
~~~~
git push heroku master
~~~~

DONE. -- Open the app at [https://food-nutrition.herokuapp.com/]()


### Addition

To access the files on Heroku, 
1. go to **More > Run console**.
2. run the command 
~~~~
heroku run bash
~~~~
3. Use normal bash commands.
